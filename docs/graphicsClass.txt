GRAPHICS CLASS
===============================================================================

Right now, pretty much every class in the project that has a visual
representation has it's own code for building that representation out of quads.
The only exceptions are classes that are built in like the text box and stuff.

When I say they have their own code for building that representation, they do
call a function that puts the quads into position, but they store these quads
and initialise them etc etc.

Instead, I could make a class specifically for storing a bunch of quads and it
can also have features like keeping track of when it is initialised and when to
delete it's data

Actually, now that I come to think of it, there is already a class for this,
it's called SquareShape. I haven't got a clue what I have been making my own
bloody quads for now I think of it.
