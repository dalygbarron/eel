GRAVITY
===============================================================================

There is no gravity because it makes collision detection more complicated. The
way collision detection works is that it just checks where you are gonna hit
into, and from time to time if you are flying it says stop flying.

The implication of this is that we need a structure from which to query for
collision detection information. This is fine as we need to build some such
thing anyway, and we can store it in the walkstage or wherever to save having
to recalculate it at a later date. I guess we will have to store it in the
slice.

That means in order to calculate collisions for each character we will need to
find what chunk they are in, then for that chunk we will have to iterate over
each slice and check the specific tile they may collide with. I do not think
that is too heavy tbh. I think this is quite a good system. Also I will make it
so that you can not walk off ledges.
