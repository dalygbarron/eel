PARALLELLISM
===============================================================================

If the game is a bit slow after I have done the rendering stuff pretty much
optimally, then I have got a few ideas for making it faster with parallelism.

First of all, we can make the panes be sorted and placed and rendered in
parallel by having a message queue which receives all desires to edit panes and
shit like that, and then the pane buffer thread goes:
 - process all messages in queue
 - sort
 - render

and it just does that over and over and over.
