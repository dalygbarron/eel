LISTENERS
===============================================================================

Coming back to this code base, the most rubbish part right now is that it has
got unnecessary event listeners which work the same way scripts and yields in
godot work which is not a particularly good system and which allows scripts to
zoom off into space and be lost forever.

A better system would be to completely get rid of event listeners make it that
scripts are yielded back to every single frame that the owner is updated (so
for example if a script creates a gui box, no scripts at all will be updated
until that box is gone). Therefore, a script will never need to check for when
it's gui box has dissappeared because it will have dissappeared the next time
it runs, but there will be other things where they will just need to poll every
single frame, for example to check when a sound effect has finished playing.

Polling for user input is probably for the best as there would be no way for
the handling code to know whether the piece of input was important or not so
they will resume a script just to send it junk. if you want to check on a key
press I could probably add a "was just pressed" kind of check thingy so you can
basically poll for an event.
