TILESET
===============================================================================

So tilemaps are all gonna have tilesets and there will be different tile sets
you see which is a bit of a pain in the balls you see because we want to have
all of the pictures stuck into a giant texture so how do we handle the
different tilesets that we allegedly need.

Alright I think that this shows we are going to need that big complicated idea
I had about having the texture atlas start after a reserved space at the top
which is where we will graft on whatever tileset is needed at the current time,
which is decided not by the tile map, but by the walking scene. The tilemap
will load the tileset (if it is not yet loaded) and have a reference to it, but
the walking scene will just use the tileset of the first tilemap that it loads
and from that time on it will keep using it.

If the walking scene has to load in a map which has got a different tileset to
the tileset that it is currently using then it will simply have to shit itself
and emit a warning but after that we can just keep running and see whatever
kind of fucked up looking graphics we get from using ids from one tileset on
another tileset.
