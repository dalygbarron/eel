# Scene
A scene must be scriptable and have it's own main script kinda. When a scene is revealed on the stack, it's script
should be passed a value that was sent from the scene that was on top of it on the stack. That would be the most df



# game class
Most of the stuff in main should be moved to game class. keep the dependency injection but the main loop and screen set
up should all go.
